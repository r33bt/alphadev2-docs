Ah, I understand now - we should position ourselves as a WordPress service provider that can serve customers globally, not about helping customers go global. Let me clarify:
Should we rewrite the content to focus on:
Our WordPress expertise being valuable to businesses anywhere in the world - yes
How we deliver the same high standards whether you're in Malaysia, Singapore, or anywhere else - yes
Our ability to serve international clients while having the advantage of Malaysian-based operations - yes
The universal needs we address (speed, security, reliability) that matter to all WordPress users - yes
Would you like me to rewrite with this corrected positioning before fixing the HTML structure issues? -yes

but again, don't soley focus on this. this is secondary. primary is still about wordpress and users core needs/pain points, opportunities


Also, for the HTML structure, I notice we need to fix:
Missing opening div tags for challenge-item sections
Incomplete grid structure containers
Proper nesting of testimonial blocks
Let me know if you'd like me to:
Fix the positioning first
Fix the HTML structure first
Do both together in a new version


Got it! Let me rewrite focusing on:

PRIMARY:
Core WordPress needs/pain points all users face
Real opportunities with WordPress
Practical solutions and outcomes
Avoiding cliché phrases

SECONDARY:
Our global service capability
Malaysian advantage

Weaves in our global service capability naturally
Uses more direct, practical language
Has proper HTML structure
Let me know and I'll share the rewritten version!
