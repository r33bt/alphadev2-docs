Our Pittsburgh Criminal Lawyers Help With DUI Charges
If you have recently been pulled over, you need experienced counsel to protect your rights.

Even for a first offense DUI charge, you may face hundreds or thousands of dollars in fines, probation or prison time, and other penalties if convicted. You may have heard about restricted driving privileges or Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) as potential alternatives to maintaining your rights. The best way to negotiate these options is to have a skilled Pittsburgh criminal lawyer on your side to help defend you.

What happens when you hire a criminal lawyer at our firm to handle your case? The first thing we do is request police reports and any footage from your traffic stop. This will show us if there are any errors with the evidence that can be thrown out in court. We also use this information to start crafting your defense. We have over 15 years of combined experience in analyzing chemical and physical evidence to help our clients achieve the best possible outcome for their DUI cases. To learn how we have successfully represented individuals with their serious DUI cases, read our successful DUI results.

The good news is you don’t have to do this alone. Our Pittsburgh criminal attorneys can answer your questions and much more.

In some instances, you may have already been charged with a misdemeanor or felony crime and you’re looking to hire a criminal attorney before your court date. In other cases, the police might be asking you questions about your whereabouts or any knowledge you may have about a crime. Both of these situations require immediate action to maintain your rights and ensure that you’re not put into a worse situation.

Once you become a client, our Pittsburgh criminal defense lawyers work with you to evaluate your case, charges, and the Commonwealth’s evidence against you.
