## PREMIUM DOMAIN NAMES


The legal industry is highly competitive. With over 500,000 law firms and 1.2 million lawyers in the United States alone, it's hard for a small firm to stand out.

To get noticed, lawyers need to create a unique brand to differentiate and distinguish themselves from the rest. A key part of this is the name.

In the digital world, a brand's domain name plays a vital role as the website address, as email addresses and in the overall brand identity. It directly affects a law firm's operations in many ways, particularly for branding, marketing and closing sales.

Your domain name speaks volumes about you and your firm. Your digital identity is summed up in "1-3 words and a .com" - it can wow and impress prospects as they browse through a list of lawyers, or let them pass you by.

There's a reason why savvy lawyers invest in premium domain names for their business:

- It will make a small firm look like a highly trusted brand
- It will help a new firm establish instant credibility
- It will give an automatic lift to every ad dollar spent
- It will be a marketing asset that continually generates returns

Experienced domain investors understand the value of premium domains as one-of-a-kind assets that give the website and business developed on it an instant edge.

We leverage on quality domain names for branding, SEO and building trust when creating the sites in our network. We advise clients to consider it too.



======================================================



Q: I already have a domain name and website, how can I upgrade to a better one?
A: It's quite simple - buy the domain, transfer your website onto the new domain, forward the old domain to the new one. Our team can assist to ensure a smooth transfer.

Q: Our firm already has our ideal domain name, why should we buy others?
A: To capture the benefits of these valuable assets to help your business, and prevent competitors from owning them.

Q: Why should I pay thousands of dollars for a domain when I can register one for $15?
A: The difference in quality. One is a strategic asset, the other is an operational cost. To understand domains better, it's useful to focus on the value they bring to the business, rather than only the investment cost.

Q: Why are Premium Dot Com Domains a Smart Investment?
A: Apart from the one-time initial purchase, the annual holding cost is only $15. For a key asset that will build trust, authority and a stronger bottom line for your business, it's quite a no brainer.

Q: Why do some companies own multiple or many tens of domains, and what do they do with it?
A: Everyone has a primary domain/website. Many will own spelling variations of it to make sure no one else can own or use them. They forward the traffic from these domains to the primary domain to make sure visitors reach the right destination. The truly savvy ones will own the exact match geographic and/or niche targeted .com domains relevant to their business. Secondary lead generating marketing websites can be built on these domains, or the traffic can be forwarded to the primary domain. 

Q: How can I Build Up a Portfolio of Domains that are Aligned to my Business?
A: Gradually and intentionally, focusing on quality over quantity. It's not always possible to acquire the names you want, so it's important to be ready to act when they do come on the market.

Q: Can I do this myself?
A: Yes, sure. Start by compiling a list of potential domains then register any that are available, negotatiate to purchase others in the aftermaket, and monitor the remainder to see when they come onto the market for sale.

Q: How can LegalDN help?
A: 

- primary domain:
- spelling variations:
- exact match domains:
- secondary websites:
- defensive acquisitions:
