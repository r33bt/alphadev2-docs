- WhatsApp evidence of threats linking access to payments
- Education and activities disrupted
- Attempts to resolve peacefully failed

### 2.4 Duress and Coercion

- Evidence: WhatsApp messages, timeline of demands, financial incapacity

### 2.5 Children's Welfare and Education Disruption
- Academic progress under Applicant's care (IGCSE, curriculum, plans)
- Disruption since breach: excessive gaming, late wake-up, cessation of activities

- Applicant's financial incapacity: debts, income, inability to pay demanded sums

### 2.7 Good Faith and Settlement Attempts
- Applicant consistently sought to negotiate and avoid conflict
- Respondent escalated only when external support ended or demands unmet

## 4. STRATEGIC NOTES & KEY ADVICE (from aichat analysis)

- Emphasize that the original agreement was fair, voluntary, and based on Respondent's then-financial independence.
- Highlight that Respondent's breach is due to her own financial circumstances and loss of external support, not any change in Applicant's conduct.
- Clearly state that any new financial agreements were made under duress, with attached evidence.
- Focus on children's welfare, education, and stability as the primary concern.
- Document Applicant's good faith, peaceful conduct, and necessity of filing now.
- Show Respondent's pattern of using children as leverage and making threats.
- Document Applicant's financial incapacity and Respondent's inconsistent claims.
- Organize evidence by incident and theme for clarity.
- Hold back some evidence (e.g., card incident) for reply if Respondent denies or misrepresents facts.
