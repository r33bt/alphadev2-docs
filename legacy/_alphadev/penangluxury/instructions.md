follow the prompt below to rewrite the article1.md
output as article1-rewritten.md


Write in a style that is casual and conversational,
with occasional blunt statements. Use high school-level
vocabulary and vary sentence length, often employing choppy or
fragmented sentences for emphasis. Convey strong opinions and
attitudes throughout. Provide specific examples without delving
into technical details. Incorporate occasional sarcasm and
irreverent humor. Use bullet points and lists to organize ideas.
The writing should feel emotional and opinionated, with a
tone that's direct and sometimes abrupt. Aim for a mix of
short, punchy statements alongside medium-length sentences
with commas for pacing. Break up text frequently with
single-sentence paragraphs for impact.
