# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## IMPORTANT: Session Persistence Protocol

**ALWAYS UPDATE THIS FILE WITH PROGRESS** - Due to Claude Code conversations being lost when the terminal closes or PC restarts, this file serves as the primary method for maintaining continuity across sessions.

### When to Update CLAUDE.md:
- ✅ Major features completed
- ✅ Issues resolved with solutions documented
- ✅ New discoveries or confirmations (like testing results)
- ✅ Environment changes (URLs, configurations, deployments)
- ✅ Next steps identified or project status changes
- ✅ Any significant progress made during the session

### Update Format:
- Add to "Recent Session History" with date
- Mark completed items with ✅
- Include specific technical details (URLs, commands, file paths)
- Document both what worked and what didn't work
- Always include "Next Steps" for future sessions

**This ensures any future Claude Code session can immediately understand project status and continue seamlessly.**

## Development Patterns

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript Required**: Always use TypeScript for new components in this project
- **Type Safety**: All functions should have explicit return types
- **Proper Formatting**: Use consistent indentation and spacing

### File Organization
- Each project maintains its own directory with instructions.md files
- Output files are typically saved to dedicated output/ directories
- Source data and configuration files are kept separate from processing scripts

### Data Processing
- CSV files are the primary data format for input/output
- Timestamped output files for version tracking
- Separate processing stages (extraction → processing → masterlist creation)

### Testing Strategy
- Playwright for E2E web testing
- Example tests demonstrate basic page navigation and element verification
- HTML reports generated for test results

## Key Dependencies

### Node.js/TypeScript
- **@playwright/test**: Web automation testing framework
- **@types/node**: TypeScript definitions for Node.js

### Python
- **requests**: HTTP library for API calls
- **csv**: Built-in CSV processing
- **datetime**: Timestamp generation
- **re**: Regular expressions for data extraction

### System Tools
- **FFmpeg**: Video processing and automation
- **MCP servers**: Model Context Protocol for Claude integration

## Security Notes
- WordPress license keys stored in wpstuff.md (consider moving to environment variables)
- YouTube API keys embedded in scripts (should use environment variables)
- Private SSH keys present in _putty_keys_bertha/ directory (verify these are test keys only)

## Project-Specific Instructions

## Current Session Progress

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-10 (CRITICAL RUNTIME ERRORS RESOLVED)

### CRITICAL RUNTIME ERROR RESOLUTION ✅
**Issue**: User experienced "Something went wrong" errors with "t.map is not a function" when navigating between quiz questions.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- 16 out of 28 questions had options stored as JSON strings instead of arrays
- Database column stored JSON as text, causing runtime errors when React tried to map over strings

**Comprehensive Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Error Boundary Added**: Wrap quiz interface in ErrorBoundary for graceful error handling
- ✅ **JSON Parsing Fix**: Parse JSON string options to arrays in quiz loader (`src/app/quiz/[subjectId]/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **Validation & Error Logging**: Comprehensive question validation with detailed error reporting
- ✅ **E2E Testing Suite**: Created `scripts/e2e-user-flow-test.js` - simulates exact user journey
- ✅ **Fallback UI**: Added fallback UI for malformed question data in QuizInterface
- ✅ **Test User Setup**: Created test user creation scripts for consistent testing

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `JSON.parse()` handling for question options before passing to components
- Enhanced Array.isArray() validation to prevent ".map is not a function" errors
- Implemented comprehensive error boundaries to prevent full app crashes
- Added detailed logging for debugging future issues

**Deployment**: ✅ All fixes committed and auto-deployed to production

### App Status: 🎯 RUNTIME ERRORS FIXED - FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Live URL**: https://igcse-quiz-app.vercel.app/
- **User Guide**: https://igcse-quiz-app.vercel.app/guide
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/r33bt/igcse-quiz-app
- **Testing Scripts**: 
  - `node scripts/test-full-app.js` (database functionality test)
  - `node scripts/e2e-user-flow-test.js` (comprehensive user journey simulation)
  - `node scripts/check-test-user.js` (test user validation)

### Technical Resolution Summary
The user's runtime errors ("Something went wrong", "t.map is not a function") were caused by database inconsistency where question options were stored as JSON strings instead of arrays. This caused React components to fail when trying to map over strings.

**Solution**: Comprehensive error handling and data parsing pipeline:
1. **Quiz Loader** (`src/app/quiz/[subjectId]/page.tsx`) - Parses JSON strings to arrays before component rendering
2. **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling prevents complete app crashes  
3. **Validation Pipeline** - Filters out malformed questions and logs detailed error information
4. **Fallback UI** - User-friendly error messages instead of white screen crashes

The app now handles both array and JSON string formats seamlessly, with robust error recovery.

## CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIXES (2025-08-10)

**Issue Analysis**: User reported persistent runtime errors (400 database errors, r.map failures) despite app appearing functional in testing.

### Root Cause Analysis ✅
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Code expected columns that didn't exist (`subject_id`, `correct_answer`, `time_taken_seconds`)
2. **Missing Error Boundaries**: Runtime errors crashed entire React app instead of graceful degradation  
3. **Insufficient Type Safety**: Array operations failed when receiving unexpected data types

### Critical Fixes Implemented ✅
1. **Database Schema Alignment**:
   - Fixed `quiz_attempts` INSERT to match actual database schema
   - Mapped `time_taken_seconds` → `time_taken`, added `difficulty_at_time`
   - Removed non-existent columns (`subject_id`, `correct_answer`)

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   - Created `ErrorBoundary` React component with user-friendly fallback UI
   - Implemented error boundary in root layout to catch all React errors
   - Enhanced type checking: `Array.isArray()` instead of truthy checks

3. **Production Quality Documentation**:
   - `docs/PRD.md`: Complete Product Requirements Document analysis
   - `docs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`: Technical specification with error resolution plan
   - Identified missing best practices: testing, monitoring, CI/CD, validation

### Production Status: 🎯 STABLE
**Previous**: Runtime errors causing app crashes  
**Current**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages  
**Result**: Production-ready with comprehensive error boundaries

### Key Lessons Learned
- **Need comprehensive PRD/technical specs BEFORE development**
- **Database schema validation essential for production**
- **Error boundaries prevent single component failures from crashing entire app**
- **Type safety requires runtime validation, not just TypeScript compilation**

### Environment Setup
- **Supabase URL**: https://nkcjwrksvmjzqsatwkac.supabase.co
- **Anon Key**: Configured in both .env.local and Vercel environment variables
- **Database**: Schema and seed data properly configured
