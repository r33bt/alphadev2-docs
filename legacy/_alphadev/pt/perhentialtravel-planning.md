what percentage of perhential hotel bookings go through OTAs, how many through local travel agents, direct and other

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Specific data on the distribution of hotel bookings in the Perhentian Islands among online travel agencies (OTAs), local travel agents, direct bookings, and other channels is not readily available. However, general trends in Malaysia's travel booking behavior can offer some insights.

According to a study by Tourism Malaysia, the majority of Malaysian travelers prefer to book directly with hotels and airlines, followed by using OTAs for their outbound travel.

[tourism.gov.my](https://www.tourism.gov.my/files/uploads/Malaysian-Outbound-and-Domestic-Travel-Behavior.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
This suggests a significant preference for direct bookings among Malaysian travelers.

Additionally, OTAs play a crucial role in hotel bookings by providing extensive marketing and distribution channels. They are favored by travelers for their convenience, variety, and competitive pricing. Hotels often collaborate with multiple OTAs to increase visibility and reach a broader audience.

While specific percentages for the Perhentian Islands are not available, it's reasonable to infer that hotel bookings are distributed among direct bookings, OTAs, and local travel agents, with direct bookings and OTAs likely comprising substantial portions. The exact distribution would depend on factors such as the hotel's marketing strategies, target demographics, and the overall popularity of the destination.

### **Why is this important?**

* **Most hotels rely on OTAs like Agoda & Booking.com**, paying **15-30% commission per booking**.  
* **If you offer a lower commission (e.g., 10-15%),** hotels will **prefer to work with you directly**.  
* **Many smaller guesthouses & chalets lack direct booking systems**‚Äîthey depend on **WhatsApp or phone reservations**, which you can help streamline.

### **How to Approach Hotels/Resorts:**

‚úÖ **Step 1: Build a List of Hotels & Chalets**

* Use Google Maps, Agoda, and Booking.com to find **every accommodation provider on Perhentian**.

  * **Budget Chalets** ‚Äì Senja Bay Resort, Maya Chalet.

* Pitch how **your agency can reduce their OTA reliance** and bring in **more direct customers**.  
* Negotiate **exclusive deals** (e.g., packages with breakfast, free snorkeling).  
* **Example deal structure:**  
  * Standard commission: **10-15% per booking** (lower than OTAs).  
  * Offer **higher rates for exclusive partnerships** (e.g., you‚Äôre the only agency selling their rooms).  
  * Use **a simple contract** to formalize the agreement.

‚úÖ **Step 3: Build a Bulk Booking Agreement**

* **Bulk book rooms during peak seasons (March ‚Äì October)** to guarantee availability for your clients.  
* Negotiate a **lower rate per room** by committing to **regular bookings**.  
* Example:  
  * If a chalet usually charges **RM200/night**, negotiate **RM150/night** for guaranteed bookings.  
  * Sell at **RM180/night**, making RM30 profit per night per room.

###### **ChatGPT said:**

### **Step 3: Build a Bulk Booking Agreement with Perhentian Hotels & Resorts**

Securing **bulk bookings** is one of the **most realistic and profitable ways** to penetrate the Perhentian travel market. Many travel agencies and group tour operators **already do this**, and you can too‚Äîby securing rooms in advance at discounted rates and then selling them at a **higher margin**.

Let‚Äôs break this down **step-by-step**, using **realistic scenarios** and how you can confirm deals with hotels.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Why is Bulk Booking Profitable?**

* **Hotels prefer guaranteed occupancy** rather than waiting for last-minute bookings.  
* **OTAs (Agoda, Booking.com) take a 15-30% commission**‚Äîyou can negotiate a better deal directly.  
* **Tourists pay more for peak-season stays** (March ‚Äì October), so **locking in cheaper rates ahead of time** allows you to profit.  
* **Group & corporate clients** book in bulk‚Äîyou can pre-sell these rooms at a premium.

üí∞ **Example Profit Scenario** (10 rooms for 3 nights):

* Standard OTA rate per night: **RM250**  
* Bulk booking rate you negotiate: **RM180**  
* You sell for **RM220** per night.  
* **Profit per room per night: RM40**  
* **For 10 rooms x 3 nights: RM1,200 profit** üöÄ

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Life Example of Bulk Booking in Perhentian**

Many **small travel agents & tour companies** do this, especially in peak season.

‚úÖ **Example 1: Small Agencies Doing This**

* Travel agencies like **Perhentian Trans Holiday** and **Fauna Travel & Tour** bulk-book with chalets and resell to **tourists and walk-in customers** at Kuala Besut Jetty.  
* These agencies **secure rooms at budget chalets like Senja Bay, Maya Chalet, and Shari-la Resort** and sell package deals with boat transfers and activities.

‚úÖ **Example 2: Corporate & Group Bookings**

* **HR departments** in big companies often organize **team retreats** to Perhentian.  
* Agencies bulk-book 10-30 rooms and resell them with **corporate retreat packages** (including meals & activities).

‚úÖ **Example 3: How Backpacker Agencies Operate**

* Backpacker-friendly hostels like **Oh La La, Ombak Dive Resort, and Mimpi Perhentian** frequently work with **budget travel agencies** that **pre-purchase beds for group tours.**  
* These agencies book **dorm beds in advance** and then sell "Backpacker Perhentian Packages" with boat transfers & snorkeling.

üöÄ **This shows that bulk booking already works‚Äîyou just need to get in the game\!**

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step: How to Secure a Bulk Booking Agreement**

### **Step 1: Identify the Right Hotels & Chalets**

üîç **Find hotels open to direct partnerships (instead of relying fully on OTAs).**  
 Look for:

* **Smaller hotels & chalets (5-30 rooms)** ‚Üí More flexible, easier to negotiate.  
* **Hotels without full OTA reliance** ‚Üí Some chalets only list on Facebook or WhatsApp.  
* **Hotels with seasonal fluctuations** ‚Üí They need guaranteed bookings in off-peak months.

üìå **Where to find them?**

* Search **Google Maps** for **"Perhentian hotels"**.  
* Check **Facebook pages** (many chalets post availability there).  
* Look at **Traveloka/Agoda** and see which hotels have WhatsApp for direct bookings.

### **Step 2: Contact the Hotel Manager/Owner**

üìû **Best ways to reach them:**

* **Phone/WhatsApp** ‚Äì Most smaller hotels list their number on Facebook or Google.  
* **Walk-in visit** ‚Äì If you‚Äôre in Perhentian or Kuala Besut, meet them in person.  
* **Email Inquiry** ‚Äì If it‚Äôs a larger resort with corporate bookings.

üìù **What to say? (Message Template)**  
 üí¨ *"Hi \[Hotel Name\] Manager, my travel agency specializes in Perhentian bookings. I‚Äôd like to discuss a partnership where we can send you regular customers by pre-booking rooms in bulk at a special rate. Can we discuss this further?"*

---

### **Step 3: Negotiate the Bulk Rate**

üí∞ **What‚Äôs the normal discount for bulk bookings?**

* **10-20% discount** for agencies booking 5-10 rooms.  
* **30% discount** for 10+ rooms, especially if booking for **multiple nights**.  
* Some hotels may **ask for a deposit**, but you can negotiate a **"pay when booked"** deal.

‚úÖ **Key Negotiation Points:**

* **Commit to a fixed number of rooms per month** (e.g., 10 rooms, minimum 3 nights).  
* **Ask for flexible booking terms** (e.g., free cancellation up to 7 days before).  
* **Offer to handle customer service** (some hotels hate dealing with direct tourists).  
* **Ask for extra perks** like free breakfast/snorkeling tickets to add value to your packages.

üìå **Example Deal Structure:**

| Hotel | OTA Price | Your Bulk Rate | Resale Price | Your Profit per Night |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Chalet A | RM250 | RM180 | RM220 | RM40 |
| Hotel B | RM300 | RM220 | RM260 | RM40 |

---

### **Step 4: Secure the Deal (Contract & Payment Terms)**

üìù **How to confirm the deal?**

* Get the hotel to **agree in writing** (WhatsApp is fine for small operators).  
* Larger hotels may need a **simple contract**‚Äîyou can create a basic agreement.  
* **Example contract terms:**  
  * Your agency **gets 10 rooms per month at RM180/night**.  
  * You **must confirm bookings at least 7 days in advance**.  
  * **Cancellation policy**: No penalty if canceled **7+ days before arrival**.  
  * Payment: **50% upfront, 50% upon check-in** (or full payment upon booking).

‚úÖ **Alternative: No Prepayment, Just Exclusive Pricing**  
 If you **don‚Äôt want to risk paying upfront**, negotiate:

* You get the **bulk rate only when you confirm a booking**.  
* The hotel agrees to **hold a certain number of rooms for you** until a deadline (e.g., 7 days before).

üìå **Real Example:**  
 Many **Malaysia-based travel agents do this for Langkawi, Tioman, and Perhentian**, where they **block rooms at a lower rate** and sell them to travelers at a markup.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Scaling Up: Maximizing Profits from Bulk Booking**

Once you have bulk booking deals in place, you can:

üöÄ **1\. Sell Packages Instead of Just Rooms**

* Instead of just reselling hotel rooms, bundle them with **boat transfers & snorkeling tours** for **higher profit margins**.  
* Example:  
  * **Hotel Only (RM220/night) ‚Üí RM40 profit**  
  * **Hotel \+ Snorkeling Package (RM299) ‚Üí RM80+ profit**

üöÄ **2\. Resell to Other Travel Agents**

* Once you secure bulk bookings, **offer rooms to other smaller agents** at a **slightly higher rate**.  
* Example:  
  * You get 10 rooms at **RM180/night**.  
  * Resell 5 rooms to smaller agents for **RM200/night**.  
  * **Profit: RM20 per room per night** (for doing nothing\!).

üöÄ **3\. Target Corporate & School Groups**

* Reach out to **companies & universities** for **team-building retreats**.  
* Sell **3D2N Perhentian Packages for RM599-RM999 per person**.

---

### **Final Verdict: How Realistic is This?**

‚úÖ **Many small travel agencies ALREADY do this in Perhentian**‚Äîyou‚Äôre not inventing something new.  
 ‚úÖ **Hotels prefer bulk bookings over OTA reliance** if you can guarantee guests.  
 ‚úÖ **As a new agency, offering a better commission rate (10-15%) gives you an edge.**

üí∞ **Potential Monthly Profit:**

* **10 rooms x 3 nights x RM40 profit** \= RM1,200  
* **If you book 50 rooms/month** \= RM6,000 profit **just from bulk hotel deals**\!

### **Best Ways to Earn from Marriott Bookings in Perhentian Islands**

The **Perhentian Marriott Resort & Spa** is a **high-end luxury hotel**, meaning guests are willing to spend more on premium experiences. To profit from Marriott bookings, you need **a strategic approach to commissions, direct partnerships, and package add-ons**. Here‚Äôs how:

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Become a Marriott Affiliate Partner (Earn Per Booking)**

### **Why?**

* Marriott runs **an official affiliate program** that **pays commissions** on bookings made through your website.  
* You can earn **between 3% \- 6% commission per booking**.

### **How to Join?**

‚úÖ **Option 1: Marriott Bonvoy Affiliate Program**

* Sign up via Marriott‚Äôs official [**Affiliate Program**](https://affiliates.marriott.com/).  
* Get a **unique tracking link** to place on your website.  
* Every booking made through your link **earns a commission**.

üí∞ **Potential Earnings Example:**

* **Room rate: RM800 (\~$170) per night**  
* **Average stay: 3 nights** ‚Üí **RM2,400 total booking**  
* **Commission: 5%** ‚Üí **RM120 ($25) per booking**  
* **100 bookings per month \= RM12,000 ($2,500) per month**

‚úÖ **Option 2: Third-Party Affiliate Networks (More Flexibility)**

* Marriott also partners with platforms like **CJ Affiliate (Commission Junction)**.  
* You can **track bookings, optimize ads, and maximize conversions**.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Direct Partnerships with Marriott (Bulk or Exclusive Rates)**

### **Why?**

* Marriott prefers **direct high-volume bookings** instead of paying OTAs (Expedia, Agoda, Booking.com).  
* If you bring **regular customers**, you can negotiate **exclusive discounted rates**.

### **How to Negotiate a Deal?**

‚úÖ **Step 1: Contact Marriott‚Äôs Sales Team**

* Find the **hotel‚Äôs sales manager** (call or email directly).  
* Pitch your agency‚Äôs ability to **bring consistent group bookings**.

‚úÖ **Step 2: Ask for a Preferred Agent Rate**

* Many large hotels **offer lower rates** to trusted agents **(10-20% lower than OTA rates)**.  
* Instead of earning **5% affiliate commission**, you **buy at a lower rate and resell at a margin**.

üí∞ **Example of Bulk Rate Profit:**

* OTA price per night: **RM800**  
* Your negotiated rate: **RM680**  
* You sell for **RM750**, making **RM70 per night**.  
* **3-night booking \= RM210 profit**  
* **50 bookings per month \= RM10,500 profit**

‚úÖ **Step 3: Secure VIP Perks & Packages**

* Offer Marriott guests **exclusive bonuses** (e.g., free island tour, private dinner, or spa discount).  
* These **perks increase conversion rates** for your agency vs. direct Marriott bookings.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Sell Premium Travel Packages Featuring Marriott (High-Ticket Sales)**

### **Why?**

* Marriott attracts **high-spending luxury travelers**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Resell Marriott Stays to Other Travel Agents (B2B Model)**

üí∞ **Example Profit Calculation:**

whats the best option/solution for our website's booking engine? we have wordpress experience and have used hbook plugin for a airbnb site we built. one option is to use that and add the rooms/hotels all into one central site. but if there is a more robust non wordpress solution, that may be better as i prefer not to have to maintain the site/system if possible.

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Selecting an optimal booking engine is crucial for your Perhentian Islands-focused travel agency, especially considering your WordPress experience and desire for a low-maintenance solution. Below are tailored recommendations:

**1\. WordPress-Based Solution: HBook Plugin**

Given your familiarity with WordPress and previous experience with the HBook plugin, this remains a viable option. HBook allows for seamless integration of booking functionalities into your site, enabling the management of multiple properties from a centralized platform. However, this approach requires ongoing maintenance, including updates and security management.

**2\. Third-Party Booking Platforms**

If minimizing maintenance is a priority, partnering with established booking platforms can be advantageous:

* **Amadeus IT Group**: A leading provider of travel technology solutions, Amadeus offers comprehensive booking systems that cater to travel agencies. Their platform supports real-time reservations and inventory management, reducing the need for in-house system maintenance.  
   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_IT_Group?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **SiteMinder**: Specializing in hotel distribution and direct booking technology, SiteMinder enables agencies to connect with a vast network of hotels. Their platform offers integrations with various property management systems, facilitating seamless operations without extensive upkeep.  
   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteminder?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**3\. White-Label Solutions**

For a customized yet low-maintenance approach, consider white-label booking solutions:

* **Mozio**: Mozio provides a white-label platform that aggregates various transportation options, including shuttles and taxis. While primarily focused on ground transportation, integrating such services can enhance your agency's offerings.  
   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozio?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Recommendations:**

* **Assess Integration Capabilities**: Ensure that the chosen platform integrates seamlessly with your existing systems and supports the specific services you offer.

* **Evaluate Costs**: Compare pricing structures, including setup fees, transaction fees, and any ongoing costs, to determine the most cost-effective solution.

* **Consider User Experience**: Opt for a platform that offers a user-friendly interface for both your team and clients, enhancing overall satisfaction.

By aligning your choice with your agency's operational needs and technical capabilities, you can implement a booking engine that streamlines processes while minimizing maintenance efforts.

üî• **Once we go live, we can focus on SEO traffic & scaling up\!** Would you like help with the **best setup practices for HBook?** üòä

##### **You said:**

i think hbook isnt designed to be a multivendor (ie with different hotels) solution. what are potential issues and can we have a feasible workarouind solutiuon

###### **ChatGPT said:**

You're absolutely right‚Äî**HBook is designed for single-property bookings**, which makes it **not ideal for a multi-vendor (multi-hotel) setup**. However, there are **workarounds** that can still make it feasible, though they come with limitations.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Potential Issues with Using HBook for Multi-Hotel Booking**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 1: No Built-In Multi-Vendor Support**

**Problem:** HBook treats all bookings as part of **one central property**, which means:

* There is no way to **assign hotels to separate owners/admins**.  
* **All bookings & payments go to one central account** (yours), instead of hotels getting paid directly.  
* No way for **hotel owners to log in and manage their own listings**.

**Workaround:**  
 ‚úÖ **List each hotel as a "Room Type" or "Property"**

* Instead of listing "Standard Room" vs. "Deluxe Room," **each hotel is listed as a separate entity**.  
* Example:  
  * Hotel 1 ‚Üí "Deluxe Room \- Hotel A"  
  * Hotel 2 ‚Üí "Seaview Suite \- Hotel B"  
  * Hotel 3 ‚Üí "Budget Room \- Hotel C"

‚úÖ **Centralized Admin Model**

* **Your agency collects all payments** and manually **pays the hotels at the end of each month**.  
* **You handle booking confirmations & cancellations** instead of hotel owners.

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 2: No Direct Hotel Logins**

**Problem:** Hotels **can‚Äôt manage their own inventory, pricing, or availability** through HBook. You would have to **manually update availability** for each hotel.

**Workaround:**  
 ‚úÖ **Use a Google Sheet for Hotels to Update Availability**

* Each hotel gets access to **a shared Google Sheet** to update their availability.  
* Your team **syncs this with HBook manually once per day**.  
* Not real-time, but reduces workload.

‚úÖ **Automate with WP All Import \+ Google Sheets**

* Use **WP All Import Plugin** to **sync hotel availability from a spreadsheet** to HBook daily.

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 3: Payment Processing for Multiple Vendors**

**Problem:** HBook **does not split payments** among different hotels automatically.

* If a customer books **Hotel A**, the money goes to **your account**, not Hotel A‚Äôs.  
* You would need to manually **pay the hotels later** (e.g., weekly or monthly).

**Workaround:**  
 ‚úÖ **Commission-Based Model** (Centralized Payments)

* You **collect all bookings** and **pay out hotels** on a schedule (weekly/monthly).  
* Hotels **agree to let you handle payments** in exchange for **a marketing fee (e.g., 10-15% per booking)**.

‚úÖ **Manual Payment Redirect (Not Ideal, But Possible)**

* You can **manually send customers a payment link** for each hotel (e.g., direct bank transfer).  
* This is **high-friction** and **not scalable**, so only useful for low-volume businesses.

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 4: No Search Filtering by Hotel Name**

**Problem:** HBook **doesn‚Äôt allow customers to search by hotel name**. Instead, it treats all listings as rooms under one property.

**Workaround:**  
 ‚úÖ **Use a Custom Taxonomy for Hotel Listings**

* Use **Custom Fields** to add ‚ÄúHotel Name‚Äù as a dropdown filter.  
* Customers **filter listings by hotel** instead of searching manually.

‚úÖ **Use Elementor \+ Custom Listing Pages**

* Instead of using the built-in HBook display, **build a page for each hotel** using Elementor or a page builder.  
* Each hotel gets its own **dedicated page**, which links to the booking engine.
