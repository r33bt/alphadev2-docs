## What is Mediation?

Mediation is a voluntary process where parties having a dispute can settle their differences amicably with the assistance of a mediator. The mediation session will be held within thirty (30) days after the parties have signed the Consent Agreement for Mediation.

## Advantages of Mediation

Choosing mediation offers several benefits:
- Encourages the disputing parties to exercise ultimate right to speak in resolving dispute
- Promotes cooperation between parties
- Saves time and costs
- Assures confidentiality of all communications during negotiation
- Preserves and improves relationship of the parties
- Does not aggrieve any parties despite failure to obtain resolution
- Often results in a mutual and amenable resolution decided by parties themselves
