# Migration Plan: WordPress to Vercel
## Detailed Step-by-Step Process

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Verify site accessibility and content structure
- [ ] Test web scraping approach on sample pages
- [ ] Prepare development environment
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure Vercel account
- [ ] Document current site performance metrics

### Phase 1: Site Analysis & Content Extraction

#### Step 1.1: WordPress Structure Analysis
```bash
# Execute: scripts/01-site-analysis.sh
# Expected Output:
# - Site structure mapping
# - Content inventory (posts, pages, media)
# - Navigation structure
# - SEO metadata analysis
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete sitemap extracted
- All content URLs identified
- Site structure documented in `data/site-structure.json`

#### Step 1.2: Content Extraction
```bash
# Execute: scripts/02-content-extraction.sh
# Expected Output:
# - All post/page content extracted
# - Images and media assets cataloged
# - Metadata (titles, dates, categories) captured
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 55+ blog posts extracted successfully
- 2 pages (About, Contact) extracted
- All content stored in `data/extracted-content/`

### Phase 2: Next.js Site Generation

#### Step 2.1: Project Scaffolding
```bash
# Execute: scripts/03-nextjs-generation.js
# Expected Output:
# - Next.js project created in generated-sites/
# - All pages and posts generated as components
# - Navigation and layout components created
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Next.js project builds without errors
- All content pages accessible via routing
- Design matches modern blog standards

#### Step 2.2: Content Integration & Styling
- Dynamic routing setup for blog posts
- Category and tag filtering
- SEO optimization (meta tags, structured data)
- Responsive design implementation

### Phase 3: Deployment & Configuration

#### Step 3.1: GitHub Setup
- Initialize Git repository
- Push generated code to GitHub
- Configure GitHub Actions (optional)

#### Step 3.2: Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Execute: scripts/04-deployment.sh
# Expected Output:
# - Site deployed to Vercel
# - Custom domain configured
# - Performance optimization enabled
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Site accessible at temporary Vercel URL
- All pages loading correctly
- Performance metrics meeting targets

#### Step 3.3: DNS & Go-Live
- Configure custom domain (onedaywebsite.org)
- Set up redirects from WordPress to Vercel
- Monitor for any issues

### Phase 4: Verification & Optimization

#### Step 4.1: Functionality Testing
- [ ] All posts and pages accessible
- [ ] Navigation working correctly
- [ ] Contact forms functional
- [ ] Images loading properly
- [ ] SEO metadata present

#### Step 4.2: Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times < 2 seconds
- [ ] Core Web Vitals passing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

#### Step 4.3: SEO Verification
- [ ] URL structure maintained
- [ ] Meta descriptions present
- [ ] Structured data implemented
- [ ] XML sitemap generated

### Post-Migration Tasks

#### Immediate (Day 1)
- Monitor error logs and fix any issues
- Verify all critical pages loading
- Test contact forms and user interactions
- Check Google Search Console for crawl errors

#### Short-term (Week 1)
- Monitor server CPU reduction
- Track page load time improvements
- Verify search engine indexing
- Gather user feedback

#### Long-term (Month 1)
- Analyze cost savings achieved
- Plan content update workflow
- Evaluate performance metrics
- Prepare for scaling to additional sites

### Rollback Plan

#### If Migration Fails
1. **Keep WordPress Site Active**: Original site remains functional
2. **DNS Rollback**: Point domain back to WordPress
3. **Investigate Issues**: Debug and fix problems
4. **Retry Migration**: Execute migration again with fixes

#### Risk Mitigation
- No downtime risk (parallel migration approach)
- Original WordPress site preserved
- Quick DNS rollback capability
- Comprehensive testing before go-live

### Success Metrics Tracking

#### Performance Metrics
```bash
# Before Migration
Page Load Time: 5-8 seconds
Server CPU: 60-80%
Monthly Cost: $X

# After Migration
Page Load Time: <2 seconds
Server CPU: 10-25%
Monthly Cost: $X - savings
```

#### Technical Metrics
- Build time: <5 minutes
- Deployment time: <2 minutes
- Uptime: >99.9%
- Core Web Vitals: All green

### Content Update Process (Post-Migration)

#### For Regular Updates
1. Update content in WordPress (for reference)
2. Re-run extraction scripts
3. Deploy updates to Vercel
4. Verify changes live

#### For Emergency Updates
1. Direct editing in GitHub
2. Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub
3. Quick fixes without full re-extraction

This plan ensures systematic, measurable migration with clear success criteria and rollback options.
